# train-board

An app with a Ruby on Rails 6 backend and a React and Redux front end. This app simulates a train board at your station of choosing. It can also save and display trains that you enter on your own train board. Some seeds are included.

The server is on localhost:3001/api/v1. The front end is on localhost:3000.

The commands are: in the train-board-api, run "rails s -p 3001", "rails db:migrate", and then "rails db:seed".

In the train-board-front directory, run "npm start".
