# train-board

An app with a Ruby on Rails 6 backend and a React and Redux front end.

This app simulates a train board at an Amtrak station station of your choosing. It can also save and display trains that you enter on your own train board. Some seeds are included.

The server is on localhost:3001/api/v1. The front end is on localhost:3000.

The commands are: in the backend_train_api, run "rails s -p 3001", "rails db:migrate", and then "rails db:seed".

In the front-end directory, run "npm i && npm start".
